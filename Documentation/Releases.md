## What is the version system for releases?

Releases will have a "V_#.##.##" based numbering system. The first number is the "major revision" which is increased when changes that are
incompatable with previous versions of the software are made; The second number is the "minor revision" which is increased when functionality has
been added in a backwards compatable manner, and the final number is the "patch revision" which is increased when a bug-fix or patch is released.

## How do I know which release is stable?
Releases will have been flagged with the pre-release flag which is bultin to GitHub, and will have the word 'BETA' in the name of the release if it is not stable.
